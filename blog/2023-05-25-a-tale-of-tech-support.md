# A Tale of Tech Support and the Myth of Support's Glass Ceiling

### Starting Up Support

Having spent the lion's share of my career within various Tech Support organizations, I have a thought or two to share.

Technical Support plays a pivotal role in the growth and success of most startups, especially those in the tech sector. They're the 'human' touch in a world of codes and algorithms, vital in building and maintaining user satisfaction. However, the shiny armor of these knights begins to tarnish as companies grow and evolve. This challenge hits hardest for professionals entering tech support roles from non-traditional backgrounds. Imagine, a retail worker who went through a code school for 8 weeks? Support might be your way in, and that's not just okay - it's fantastic!

### From Direct Support to Self Serve Automation and Premier Offerings

In the startup fairy tale, tech support professionals are the unsung heroes. They fuel user engagement, untangle technical issues, and contribute to user satisfaction. However, as startups grow out of their baby shoes, there's a shift from intense user-focused support to self-service models. While this transition may look like a smart money move, it can downgrade the user experience and the perceived value of tech support within the company. It's like swapping out your human chess player for a chess app - not quite the same, right?

### The Corporate Culture Challenge: Overcoming the IT Crowd Perception

These professionals often find themselves bumping their heads against a glass ceiling when looking to advance their careers. 'Misconceptions R Us' could be the internal tagline, creating barriers to career growth. I've witnessed attitudes suggesting, "if your goal was Engineering, you should not have applied for a Support position." This mindset is as widespread as it is damaging. It's like casting aside your loyal support teams after squeezing the value out of them, only to replace them with chatbots and self-service forums. Now, don't get me wrong - a forum is a vital piece of the online community puzzle, but that's a topic for another day.

### Structures and Attitudes: Understanding the Impact of Organizational Alignment

A company's blueprint can significantly impact opportunities available to tech support professionals. When Support orgs are nestled under the protective wing of Product or Engineering orgs, there's often a clearer path for progression and growth. But when Support is lumped in with Sales, tech support's role can turn transactional, reducing its value and the career aspirations of its professionals. And let's face it, when support is seen as a cost center rather than an integral service, it's often the first to feel the squeeze after a company's initial growth phase. Ironic as that's often how a company will earn its reputation. A good product is cool, but what sets XYZ Company apart? Their outstanding Support, of course! Humans that care, listen, and will problem solve for your specific use case that doesn't exist in a knowldege base article or public documentation yet!

### Tech Support as a Legitimate and Viable Career

Tech support isn't just a rung on the career ladder; it's a legitimate career in its own right. The skills, knowledge, and experience gained in these roles are invaluable. Furthermore, the journey from tech support to engineering or other tech roles should be seen not as skipping the queue, but as a valid pathway into the tech industry.

### Some final thoughts

Non-traditional tech support professionals face unique challenges but also bring a unique perspective to the tech industry. It's time we acknowledge this value, removing the barriers and misconceptions that stunt their growth. We should redefine tech support as not just a crucial cog in the startup wheel, but as a stepping stone to the wider opportunities the tech industry offers. So, let's acknowledge, honor, and accept the "foot in the door," and the pipeline from Support to Engineering. It's not a loophole to be abused - it's a sign of a healthy, growing company!"

That was a lot! Or at least, it felt like a lot... Whew!
