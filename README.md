# NethWorksNet

This is the repo for my personal website and pseudo portfolio.

This is a simple HTML, CSS and Js site, but with usage of [the marked library](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) to render out markdown pages as readable HTML documents!

My actions workflows here might also be interesting to some folks, since I wanted to be able to click a button to start a new blog post, and have the site automatially add it to the list of available posts, based on their publish date.

Note that this is being hosted on Netlify!
